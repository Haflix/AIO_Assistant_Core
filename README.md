# AIO_Assistant_Core
This is the core of an All-In-One (Home-) Assistant. It is supposed to load all the classes and manage their requests across multiple devices.

IM CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS REPOSITORY. It is not finished as of now. I coded by myself for some time but wanted to make my progress etc public in case someone is interested in the project or has ideas, finds bugs or whatever really. I have some more versions on my PC that I will upload one by one as of now. I will remove this text as soon as im finished uploading and documenting the version changes.
