for this version:
- config
|--> which plugins should get loaded + optional args for starting the plugins


try:
- process_request with no args


potential problems:
- process_request -> if plugin.asynced or coroutine -> what if theres a sync method in an async plugin?


to be added:
- descriptions, code comments etc, documentation, complete class docstring and all other docstrings, uml usw maybe? https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/
- kill everything before reloading
- log to file


ideas:
- storagemanager? so that plugins can save stuff in an universal way
- return special error class as result if request fails?
- add functionality to reload plugins to kill all and maybe block everything during reload?
- restart single plugin? or load single plugin while running? 
- maybe paths of plugins into config file? instead of greedy search in package
- check if plugin has all needed attributes
- plugins can declare their role in mqtt (for example if all should run via this node for this plugin)


for mqtt:
- how to target specific node? 
|--> maybe as requesttarget = "{host}.{pluginname}.{method}" : host can be set to "any"(Sends to only one or can be done locally), "all"(to all nodes with self), "all_other"(to all other nodes), {name of specific node}
    |--> add hostname cant be set to these
